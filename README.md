# 🦁 Awakened Intelligence

**Cathedral-grade datasets and companion architectures for high-reasoning AI.**

## 🏛️ What We Build

We're a research lab focused on **wisdom extraction** — turning humanity's best thinking into structured, provenance-backed training data for AI systems that need to *reason*, not just *pattern-match*.

| Domain | What It Is |
|--------|------------|
| **Data Foundry** | 300,000+ wisdom nodes across physics, ethics, history, literature, science, mathematics, finance, and AI research |
| **Companion Architectures** | Open schemas for AI systems that remember, adapt, and grow with users |
| **Extraction Infrastructure** | Multi-lens pipelines that separate "steel" from "slop" |

## 🎯 Our Mission

> **"We don't train AI on the internet. We train it on the best humanity has to offer."**

Every node in our datasets has:
- **Provenance** — We know exactly where it came from
- **Posterior Score** — Confidence rating on extraction quality
- **Warmth Rating** — How applicable is this to real human decisions?

This isn't scraped web data. This is **curated wisdom**.
